# Reinforcement-Learning-Gravitar
This repo contains code for training a reinforcement learning agent on the Gravitar Atari gym environment. This was an assignment for the third year reinforcement learning module. The agent is based on the NGU agent described in Never Give Up Learning Directed Exploration Strategies: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06038v1 replacing the base R2D2 agent with a Recurrent DQN with the following extensions:
*  Duelling
*  Noisy Layers
*  Prioritised Experience Replay
